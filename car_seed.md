## 🧠 1. Automotive Fundamentals

### 🔥 Engines & Powertrains
- The **4-stroke cycle**: intake → compression → power → exhaust.  
- **Combustion** mixes air and fuel; **spark ignition** or **compression ignition (diesel)** initiates power.  
- **Compression ratio** affects power, efficiency, and octane requirements.  
- **Fuel types**: gasoline, diesel, ethanol blends, LPG, hydrogen, etc.  
- **Turbochargers** use exhaust gases to compress intake air.  
- **Superchargers** are belt-driven air compressors providing instant boost.  
- **Hybrid powertrains** combine an ICE with electric motors.  
- **EVs** use battery packs and inverters to power motors directly.  
- **Transmissions**: manual, automatic, CVT, dual-clutch, eCVT (hybrid).  
- **Drivetrain layouts**: FWD, RWD, AWD, 4WD, mid-engine, rear-engine.  
- **Differentials** distribute torque (open, limited-slip, locking, electronic).  
- **Cooling system**: radiator, water pump, thermostat, coolant passages.  
- **Lubrication system**: oil pump, filter, viscosity rating (e.g., 0W-20).

## ⚡ 2. Electrical & Electronic Systems

### 🔋 Battery & Charging
- Common types: lead-acid, AGM, lithium-ion, LFP.  
- **Alternator** recharges the battery while the engine runs.  
- **Voltage regulator** keeps system voltage ~13.5–14.7 V.  
- **Starter motor** cranks the engine via the flywheel.

### 🧩 ECU & Sensors
- The **ECU (Engine Control Unit)** manages fuel injection, ignition, and emissions.  
- Key sensors:  
  - **MAF** – air mass flow  
  - **MAP** – manifold pressure  
  - **O₂ sensor** – exhaust air/fuel ratio  
  - **Knock sensor** – detonation detection  
  - **TPS** – throttle position  
  - **Crankshaft/Camshaft sensors** – engine timing  
- Modern cars use **CAN Bus** networks to link modules (ABS, airbag, transmission).

## 🛞 3. Chassis, Suspension & Steering

- **Suspension types**:  
  - MacPherson strut  
  - Double wishbone  
  - Multi-link  
  - Torsion beam  
- **Springs**: coil, leaf, air, torsion bar.  
- **Dampers**: control rebound and compression.  
- **Steering**: hydraulic, electric (EPS), variable ratio.  
- **Wheel alignment**: camber, toe, caster angles.  
- **Braking systems**:  
  - Disc vs drum  
  - ABS, EBD, Brake Assist  
  - Regenerative braking in EVs  
- **Tires**: check monthly (cold), rotate every 8–10k km, correct load and speed rating.

## 🧯 4. Safety Systems

- **Active safety**: systems that prevent accidents  
  - ABS, ESC, TCS, lane-keep assist, collision avoidance.  
- **Passive safety**: systems that protect in accidents  
  - Airbags, crumple zones, seatbelt pretensioners.  
- **Torque wheel nuts** to manufacturer specs using a torque wrench.  
- Always use **jack stands** — never rely solely on a jack.

## ⚙️ 5. Maintenance & Service

- **Oil & Fluids**
  - Use oil grade/spec from owner’s manual (e.g., 0W-20 API SP).  
  - Replace oil filter each oil change.  
  - Brake fluid absorbs moisture — flush every ~2 years.  
  - Coolant types are not universally compatible.  
- **Tires**
  - Check pressure monthly (including spare).  
  - Rotate tires every 8–10k km.  
- **Brakes**
  - Warped rotors cause vibration under braking.  
  - Replace pads before metal-to-metal contact.

## ⚡ 6. Electric & Hybrid Vehicle Essentials

- **Battery management system (BMS)** balances cells and prevents over/under-voltage.  
- **Preconditioning** before fast charging improves speed and battery health.  
- **Regenerative braking** converts kinetic energy into electrical energy.  
- **Thermal management** (liquid cooling or air cooling) is critical for longevity.  
- **EV charging levels**:  
  - Level 1: 120V AC (slow)  
  - Level 2: 240V AC (home or public)  
  - Level 3: DC fast charging
